DI-Hackathon-1 - Calender-app
In this project we used vanilla JavaScript, HTML and CSS to build a calendar web app that lets different users to make a todo list for each day in a specified year and month. <br/>
We have also used the localStorage web API to store the user's data (usernames, passwords, dates, adding/checked/deleted tasks).
